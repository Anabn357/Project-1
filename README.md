Visualizations developed from the U.S. Census Bureau, the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES), the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), and the U.S. Department of Education include bar charts, scatter plots, regression analyses, and hexagonal binning. They explore the relationships between values like expenditures and graduation rates, expenditures and test scores, expenditures and enrollment, and more.
